I am a Machine Learning developer, this repo will be for my personal projects.
Python, JavaScript, C, and C++ are the languages I am the most comfortable in, though I can
figure out how many other languages work.

I have competed in a lot of CTFs and gotten to the finals in the Swedish national 
championship twice (2022 & 2023) as well as getting 17th in The Swedish Armed Forces
CTF. From the national championship, I qualified for the SNHT boot camp, which is
a week-long cybersecurity intensive course in offensive ethical hacking at
KTH (Royal Institute of Technology).
