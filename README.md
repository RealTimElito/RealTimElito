I am a Metaverse and Machine Learning developer, this repo will for my personal projects.
Python, JavaScript, C, C++ are the languages I am the most comfortable in, though I can
figure out how a lot of other languages work.

I have competed in a lot of CTFâ€™s and gotten to the finals in the swedish national 
championship twice (2022 & 2023) as well as gotten 17th in The Swedish Armed Forces
CTF. From the national championship I qualified for the SNHT bootcamp, which is
a week long cybersecurity intensive course in offensive ethical hacking at
KTH (Royal Institute of Technology).
